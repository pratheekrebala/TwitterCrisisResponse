CrisisLexRec.txt is our recommended lexicon for Twitter querying. It contains an automatically-generated and human-curated list of 380 terms found to be frequently related to disasters. This was done by studying terms frequency distribution in the CrisisLexT6 collection; looking for terms that were discriminative and frequent in crisis tweets, and common across various crises; and performing a crowdsourced curation step to curate the list.
